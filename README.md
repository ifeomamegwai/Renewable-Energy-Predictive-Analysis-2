# Renewable-Energy-Predictive-Analysis-2
-  This  2nd analysis was to predicts how changes in entities renewable energy capacity influence their reduction in fossil fuel reliance.
  
-  For this analysis four models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost were considered to determine to best performing model.
  
-  Of all the models, XGBoost performed the best with an R2 of 0.39, meaning that only 39% of the variability in fossil fuel reliance reduction is explained by our model.
  
-  The remaining unexplained 61% suggests that, order than just the changes in entities renewable energy capacity considered in this analysis, there are other external factors, , such as economic, political, or technological factors, that may also influence reliance in fossil fuel reduction by entities.
  
-  MAE of 0.14 indicates relatively accurate predictions, deviating from actual values by only 0.14 on the average. 

-  The feature importance chart shows that Wind and hydro capacities had the strongest predictive impact on reducing fossil fuel reliance and should be prioritized in renewable energy strategies.
  
-  The coefficient plot shows a reasonable match between predicted and actual values. The outliers suggest the model struggles with extreme cases of fossil fuel changes.

  
-  In conclusion, While this analysis provides useful predictions to guide renewable energy investment, additional external factors beyond entities renewable energy capacity changes, such as economic, political, or technological factors, should also be considered for a fuller understanding of reduction in fossil fuel reliance.
